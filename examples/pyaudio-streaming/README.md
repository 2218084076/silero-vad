# Pyaudio Streaming Example

This example shows how micophone audio fetched by pyaudio can be processed with Silero-VAD.

It has been designed as a low-level example for binary real-time streaming using only the prediction of the model, processing the binary data and plotting the speech probabilities at the end to visualize it.
